### Application
The project is a full-stack team management application. The backend connects to a remote database and provides an API that can be used to add, remove, edit, and delete items in the database, as well as handling authentication for frontend users.

### Technology

The backend was built in Java using Maven and Spring Boot, then deployed through Azure, and the database was made with MongoDB.
